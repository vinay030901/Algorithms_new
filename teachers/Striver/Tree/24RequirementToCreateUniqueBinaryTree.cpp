/*can you construct a binary tree with follwoing?

A> assume you are given a preorder and postorder: so we can't a binary tree if these are given only.
ex preorder: 1,2,3
postorder: 3,2,1

we can create different type of trees but the preorder and postorder will be same.

B> inorder and preorder: yes we can
inorder: 9,3,15,20,7
preorder: */
