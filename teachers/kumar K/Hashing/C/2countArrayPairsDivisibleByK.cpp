/*
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n and an integer k, return the number of pairs (i, j) such that:

0 <= i < j <= n - 1 and
nums[i] * nums[j] is divisible by k.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation:
The 7 pairs of indices whose corresponding products are divisible by 2 are
(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 4).
Their products are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 respectively.
Other pairs such as (0, 2) and (2, 4) have products 3 and 15 respectively, which are not divisible by 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: There does not exist any pair of indices whose corresponding product is divisible by 5.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i], k <= 105

Intuition
Let's first understand this property:

If (a*b)%k==0, then
gcd(a,k) * gcd(b,k) % k is also 0

Letâ€™s assume two numbers 504 and 819. Their prime factorization can be written as:

504 = (2^3) * (3^2) * 7
819 = (3^2) * 7 * 13

Now gcd(504,819) = 63 and 63 = (3^2) * 7

gcd(a,b) is the multiplication of common prime factors of a and b.

Coming back to the statement
How gcd(a,k) * gcd(b,k) % k is 0 ?

For any number to be divisble by k it need to have atleast all the prime factors of k.

gcd(a,k) = Multiplication of all prime factors of k available in a.
and
gcd(b,k) = Multiplication of all prime factors of k available in b.

If gcd(a,k) * gcd(b,k) % k is 0, it means some of the prime factors of k are contributed by a and some of the prime factors of k are contributed by b and thier multiplication has all the prime factors of k which means a*b is divisble by k.

We dont care about prime factors of a or b which are not prime factors of k because they will not help us in making a*b divisible by k.

Example:

Let k=84, a=24, b=273

k = 84 = (2^2) * 3 * 7
a = 24 = (2^3) * 3
b = 273 = 3 * 7 * 13

gcd(a,k) = (2^2) * 3 (Common prime factors of a and k)
gcd(b,k) = 7 * 3 (Common prime factors of b and k)

gcd(a,k) * gcd(b,k) = (2^2) * (3^2) * 7
which has all prime factors of k thus a*b is divisble by k.

Now the solution:
As compared to checking for every pair, if we check for gcd of every number with k then the operations will be less because the number of prime factors of a number will be less.*/
