/*
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.

Example 1:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
Example 3:

Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []*/

struct TreeNode
{
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;

    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

/*for example we have
                8
              /
             5
            /  \
           2    7
suppose we need to delete 5, first we search 5 in the bst, when we find the element, then we have two choice,
1. is to connect 8 to 2 and then 7 is right of 2
2. other is to connect 8 to 7 and 2 is left of 7

we will follow the first approach for now*/
